# Horse racing application

We have 4 horses: `Jasmine`, `Puffy`, `Scotty` and `Stormwind`.

They run by making AJAX request to the related JSON files.

And now, we'll host a race between them.

So let them race together and the winner (the ajax that finished first) will be shown to the page.

How do you make a race? **Please write some codes to the `race.js` file to make it work**

*Please see the `index.html` for more detail.*
 
*We already have a `bower.json` file that setup with jQuery & bootstrap. So just use them freely, and if you need other library? No problem, just `bower install` them.*

*Googling is allowed! yay! :heart:*
