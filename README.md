# Horse racing application

We have 4 horses: `Jasmine`, `Puffy`, `Scotty` and `Stormwind`.

They run by making AJAX request to the related JSON files.

And now, we'll host a race between them.

So let them race together and the winner (the ajax that finished first) will be shown to the page.

How do you make a race? **Please write some codes to the `src/race.js` file to make it work**
